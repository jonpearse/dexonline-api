# DexOnline JSON API

This a quick and dirty JSON API built around data provided by [dexonline](https://dexonline.ro).

## What? Why?

Iâ€™m currently learning Romanian, and in so doing have stumbled across [dexonline](https://dexonline.ro): a free-to-use, [open-source](https://github.com/dexonline/dexonline) Romanian language dictionary which has gone a long way to filling in some of the gaps left by Duolingo ðŸ™ƒ

To fill in some of the other gaps, and somewhat inspired by my friend [Robb](https://robbowen.digital/), I set about building myself a little game to help me learn verb, noun, and adjective forms. While I _could_ have manually entered everything by hand, I thought Iâ€™d use Dexâ€™s JSON API to pull stuff across as I needed itâ€¦  
â€¦ except the information I need [is missing from the API](https://github.com/dexonline/dexonline/issues/969), and while I did take a look at adding the functionality myself (open source is ðŸ’œ), itâ€™s been a _very_ long time since I wrote PHP in anger. DexOnline [exports its dataset for use](https://wiki.dexonline.ro/wiki/Protocol_de_exportare_a_datelor_v5), and I figured it couldnâ€™t be _too_ hard to wrap a JSON API around it, right?

Right now Iâ€™m only running this internally, so this repo is more for folksâ€™ idle curiousity, but I _might_ get around to putting it somewhere public sometimeâ€¦

## Technical information

This tool is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (3.2+), and uses a mySQL (or compatible) database for its backend. Iâ€™m running it under macOS for development and Debian for internal production use, but it should work wherever you can get Ruby working.

### Setup

You will need:

* Ruby (Iâ€™m using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv))
* mySQL (or MariaDB)
* [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)

To get started:

1. clone this repo
2. run `bundle`  
(note: if youâ€™re running macOS + have [brew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can run `make setup` instead)
3. copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customise `DATABASE_URL` to suit your environment
3. run `rake db:migrate` to set the database up
4. run `rake dex:update` to download the latest data from dexonline  
(this may take some time: you might want to make some tea or coffeeâ€¦)
5. finally run `make run` to start the app

Once youâ€™re set up, you can check for- and download further updates by running `rake dex:update` at any time.

### API docs

The API is deliberately fairly basic:

#### `/v1/search{keyword}`

Performs a lexeme search for the given keyword, returning the entry records for those that match.

Note thatâ€”as with dexonlineâ€™s site searchâ€”this doesnâ€™t search inflected forms (so `/v1/search/copiii` will return zero results). If you wish to search inflected forms, add `?full` to the URL:

```
	/v1/search/copiii         # no resutls
	/v1/search/copiii?full    # returns entry for â€˜copil (persoanÄƒ)â€™
```

#### `/v1/search/{categorie}/{keyword}`

Performs a lexeme search as above, but restricts results by word type (that is: verb, noun, adjective, etc). Inflections are not searched by default, but can be searched by adding `?full` as above.

**Permitted values of `categorie`**

* `adjectiv`
* `forma_unica`
* `invariabil`
* `pronume`
* `substantiv_propriu`
* `substantiv`
* `verb`

#### `/v1/entry/{id}`

Returns a dictionary entry by ID, including definitions and linked lexemes.

```
	/v1/entry/20704 # returns entry for â€˜a fiâ€™ (v., to be)
```

Definition text will be partly formattedâ€”see formatting notes below.

#### `/v1/source/{id}`

Returns information source data by ID. Sources are linked from definitions.


#### `/v1/lexem/{id}`

Returns a lexeme by ID, including all inflected versions.

```
	/v1/lexem/43175 # returns lexeme data for â€˜pisicÄƒâ€™ (s.f., cat)
```

## Caveats / What this is not

This project is _not_ supposed to be any kind of replacement for dexonline, neither is it intended to be authoritative. While it attempts to import the data provided and present it in a sensible way, I accept no responsibility if it doesnâ€™tâ€”please check with the source before doing anything hasty ;)

### Note on entry definitions

Entry definitions have been included in this project for completenessâ€™ sake, but are not really related to anything I intend to use it for. As such, theyâ€™re a little bit janky in how they work and probably shouldnâ€™t be relied upon. Notably, the definition data in dexonlineâ€™s exports is provided in a custom, marked-up format which this project does its best to convert into standard HTML where possible.  

That said, its doing so differs from dexâ€”known differences are the treatment of spaced text, quoted text, and presentation of newlines; the last of which is only slightly because I canâ€™t work out how dexâ€™s formatting code actually achieves this (:

### Note on emphasis marking

Dexonline rather usefully marks emphasis in words using underlines, and this is carried over into this project via judicious use of [Unicode combining diacritical marks](https://unicode-explorer.com/b/0300), notably [U+0332](https://unicode-explorer.com/c/0332) and [U+0333](https://unicode-explorer.com/c/0332). I may yet regret this, but for now I think itâ€™s pretty coolâ€¦
